                        <p>In order to stay warm and regulate your normal body temperature, make sure to exercise at this time!</p>

                        <p>Cortisol is a steriod hormone released by the adrenal gland that causes the liver to break down muscle and fat to produce sugar and helps the body respond to stress. High amounts of cortisol, especially without enough exercise in space may lead to weight gain, muscle weakness and more. Use this time to do something productive! Plan your tasks for the day, prepare for any research and get in some exercise to maintain your cortisol levels.</p>

                        <p>There is a surge in blood pressure levels at this time due to your body trying to wake you up and get you ready for the day ahead of you! Increasing blood pressure can be an issue in space especially due to the absence of a head-to-foot blood pressure gradient, which could cause constricted blood vessels and further health problems. Limit salty and processed foods at this time and stick to fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean proteins, or low-fat dairy products.</p>

                        <h1>18:30 Highest Blood Pressure</h1>
                        <p>At this time of day, your body will have the highest blood pressure! Increasing blood pressure can be a probelm due to the absence of a head-to-foot blood pressure gradient, which could cause constricted blood vessels and further health issues. Avoid salty and processed foods and make sure to exercise and meditate.</p>

                        <h1>General Rules</h1>
                        <p>Morning and Daytime: During the morning and daytime hours, you should be exposed to bright, blue-enriched light. This type of light helps to suppress the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin and promote alertness and wakefulness. The recommended light levels during this time are typically around 1,000 to 10,000 lux. Exposure to bright light in the morning can help synchronize the body's internal clock and promote a healthy sleep-wake cycle.</p>
                        <p>Evening and Nighttime: In the evening and nighttime, you should be exposed to dimmer, warmer light. This type of light helps to stimulate melatonin production and prepare the body for sleep. The recommended light levels during this time are generally around 50 to 300 lux. Using lighting with lower color temperatures (more yellow or orange) in the evening can help promote relaxation and sleepiness.</p>
