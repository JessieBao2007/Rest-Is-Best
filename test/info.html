                            Circadian rhythms are physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a 24-hour cycle. When properly aligned they promote restorative sleep, and when disturbed sleep problems can occur.

                    <li>
                        <p>The cycle of circadian rhythms are regulated by biological clocks in our minds that are kept in sync by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) acting as a master clock.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <p>Our body has natural factors that produce circadian rhythms, such as the Period and Cryptochrome genes. However, signals from the environment also affect circadian rhythms.</p>

                    <p>Thus, it is crucial for astronauts to pay attention to factors in their environment and daily life during spaceflight. Certain aspects like light, temperature, diet, and exercise can be controlled and changed by astronauts in space.

                    </li>
                    <p>Astronauts must best follow the right circadian rhythms because circadian rhythms have large effects on significant functions in our bodies. For example, circadian rhythms impact the quality and quantity of our sleep, which can have serious consequences on our mental health, which is especially important for astronauts.
