After researching the circadian rhythm, its effect on the body and what happens when your circadian rhythm is offset or too short since astronauts experience sunrise and sunset in under 90 minutes due to constant orbiting, we created this agenda page for different times of day and what they must do at that time to maintain their circaidan rhythm.

The journal allows for the astronaut to write about their feelings every day of the week.
